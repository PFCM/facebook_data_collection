# McMac facebook tools
This is a utility to pull data from public facebook pages.
It requires facebook api authentication, in a file called auth.yaml
with appropriate app_secret and app_id keys.
in the same directory as the script. This is likely to change.

It is released under the BSD 2-clause license.
It is very preliminary, and accordingly poorly organised.
