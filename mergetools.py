"""
This is a quick script to help wrangle overlapping csv files generated by the
scraper. In particular, the problem we are looking to solve is this:

    The date ranges in the scraper need to be quite generous, because we want
    to capture new comments on older posts (we can only get comments on posts
    we already have).

    This means for large threads, we get the whole lot again, plus the new
    stuff.

    Most likely, what we want to do is just get the things we haven't got
    before. At the same time, we need some context - it is not much good to
    just take the difference because we need to know what posts the comments are
    on.

This leads to the following solution:
    given two matching csv files, one that contains more data than the other,
    output a new file that contains the symmetric difference of the two files
    AND for each group of comments, includes the post on which they are
    comments.
