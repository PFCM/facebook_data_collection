Thank you for your comment about bullbars, We have a factsheet that has information around when it is legal and necessary to have a bull bar fitted to a vehicle.

Here is the link to factsheet 22 Bullbars: http://www.nzta.govt.nz/safety/vehicle-safety/vehicle-equipment/bullbars/ 

Thank you

"2015-11-25T08:30:03+0000","TransportAgency","Allan Marsh","How come no advance warning of significant roadworks at Pukerua Bay this evening? Travelling south, came around bend and traffic was stopped right in front of me. 

I figured there must have been an accident, but when we were moving again, eventually realised there were major roadworks happening and traffic was being diverted onto my side of road when I passed the stop/go guys. 

I realise that roadworks need to happen, but there was absolutely no warning that I was approaching these.","0","0","0","","http://www.facebook.com/290135634463004/posts/641899285953302","post",
"2015-11-23T04:10:02+0000","TransportAgency","Nikita Hall","Hi NZTA, we have an issue and I’m hoping you can help. On Friday evening I was driving to Taranaki from Hamilton and came across a vehicle which had crashed into a bank on the wrong side of the road on the final turn of Mt Messenger. Thinking I was first on the scene (their lights were on and engine was running) I grabbed my cell phone and ran over to check that the occupant(s) were okay. I tried to dial emergency services, but couldn’t because there is NO reception. Not a single bar! 

After scouring the roadside for the driver (in case they’d been thrown from the car) with two other vehicles which stopped to assist, I jumped in my car and drove towards New Plymouth to get reception to call the accident in, it was at least 25 minutes before I got cell coverage on Spark or Vodafone. Luckily in this instance the driver was uninjured and moments before I arrived, they had been picked up by another vehicle and driven towards New Plymouth to find cell phone coverage. 

Now obviously we can all probably improve our driving and take better care on the roads, however sometimes accidents happen and the most important thing is that the emergency services can be contacted. The ideal solution would be enabling cell phone coverage through this area, but I’m not super hopeful this will happen. In lieu of this, could the awesome people at NZTA look into installing phone boxes which connect via landline with emergency services in areas like this which lack cell coverage, or come up with a more inspired solution? Thanks for taking the time to read this!","0","0","0","","http://www.facebook.com/290135634463004/posts/641191272690770","post",
"2015-11-21T22:16:32+0000","TransportAgency","Matt Nottage","For a government agency you need to get your stuff together. I book my full licence 5 weeks ago to do yesterday in morrinsville and no tester turned up. I sat there for 3 hours waiting with 7 other people and when we finally got hold of someone they said no one was booked in for a test in morrinsville yesterday when we were all standing there with receipts and booking slips...and then told us off for using that number because it was only instructors to use....well no other numbers were working so...maybe you actually have your 0800 number for test problems operating when tests are suppose to be happening... 

I will be expecting compensation for the hour travel to and back from morrinsville and to re book my full licence at no cost and when it suits me not you  when I call tomorrow morning.","0","0","1","","http://www.facebook.com/290135634463004/posts/640790896064141","post",

Thank you for bringing this to our attention. One possibility could be is that the lower price is just the ACC portion of the rego costs and the higher price is the one that includes the administration costs.

In saying that, I believe the links you are going through should be quoting the full price. If you would like me to investigate further, can I please ask you to private message the link for the page(s) that are giving you the prices? If you are happy to, you could also include the plate number and I will be able to give you the definitive answer for how much your rego should cost.

Expect long delays in the area with queues currently back to Northcote interchange. Latest info here: http://ow.ly/VbKRT.

6PM EDIT: DO NOT CONSIDER SH18 (Upper Harbour Motorway) & SH16 (North Western Motorway) as an alternative route as was previously advertised as a crash has just occurred citybound after St Lukes/Western Springs causing long delays after Gt North Road on this motorway also.  

7PM EDIT: The earlier crash North of the Auckland Harbour Bridge has now been cleared and all lanes are now OPEN. Traffic remains heavy between Constellation Dr & Onewa Rd. 

The earlier crash on the North Western Motorway has been cleared after Western Springs. 

A third crash is now causing delays in the separated right "bull run" lane on the Causeway citybound. Emergency services are on their way to this and traffic is heavy nearby.

"2015-11-28T01:00:02+0000","nztaakl","NZ Transport Agency - Auckland & Northland","The annual Farmers Santa Parade is on this Sunday the 29th of November!

Pre-Parade entertainment will begin from 12pm and all the action of the Farmers Santa Parade begins at 1pm. The Parade ends at approximately 2:30pm with Santa’s Party from 2:30pm to 5:00pm in Aotea Square.

Join the fun and take the family on board a bus, train, or ferry to the Parade in the Auckland city centre.

People are advised to get into the city before 11:30am to avoid frustration with traffic and parking as there will be parking restrictions and road closures between 11:30am and 4pm on Sunday. 

Buses, train and ferries will also be busier than usual. Pre-plan your journey in advance and travel early to avoid disappointment.

Parade route: The Parade Route starts at the corner of Cook Street and Mayoral Drive, turns left into Queen Street, travels down Queen Street and left again into Customs Street West then up Albert Street, ending at Albert and Wellesley Streets.

Due to road closures a number of city centre bus stops will be relocated and some route diversions in place. Auckland Transport Ambassadors will be on site to assist passengers.

With a history of crashes on this stretch of highway the road shoulder north of Pipitiwai Drive will be widened and resurfaced, including a new stone retaining wall and guardrails to reduce the risk of vehicles leaving the road.

Weather permitting, work is due to be completed by 23 December. Please take care in the area during this time as traffic control will be in place to manage some single lane closures and allow the works to take place safely.

Following community feedback regarding the safety of traffic heading south out of Warkworth and turning right into a popular winery this new turning bay will see the shoulder widened and a new guardrail installed.

Work is due to start next week and is expected to be completed by 11 December. Please take care in the area as there will be some single lane closures during this time to allow the works to take place safely.

The hut is a compliance station used by staff from the Police Commercial Vehicle Investigation Unit (CVIU) to monitor commercial trucks and their drivers to ensure the ongoing safety of the road network for all road users.

The Transport Agency funded the $100-thousand dollar project and installed the replacement hut after it was extensively damaged in 2014 when a stolen car crashed into it.

CVIU staff carry out vehicle inspections to ensure transport operators are meeting health and safety requirements and that loads are properly secured.  There’s also a newly built weigh pit to check loads.

“This stretch of State Highway 1 is used heavily by the commercial truck industry and monitoring stations like this play an important role in keeping an eye on the safety of operators and their vehicles,” says Brett Gliddon the Transport Agency’s Northland and Auckland Highway Manager. 

“It ensures not only their safety but keeps our highways safe for all road users.”","4","18","7","https://fbcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/11219224_949251708482168_1261987478263771318_n.jpg?oh=fe20c024eaef34e401db3942dc84126f&oe=56D6D14F&__gda__=1458551313_79402642f626573657bd07b04e9ed791","http://www.facebook.com/210306092376737/posts/949251755148830","post",

We have 2 nights remaining of pavement works for the Wilson to Fourth project (weather dependant). We managed to complete the membrane seal early this morning so apart from traffic travelling slowly through the site due to loose chip, traffic management is back to status quo with a single lane in both directions. 

The Fourth Ave slip lane and intersection were also completed last night. Once the night works are completed the traffic will still be running in single lanes as we will have service lids to raise and there is still property works on the western side to complete.

As part of the larger Western Ring Route project extensive work is to shortly commence on the Northwestern Motorway upgrade between Lincoln Rd and Westgate. The works will widen the motorway from 2 to 3 lanes; add a new bus shoulder lane in each direction and provide more options for walking and cycling.

If you would like the opportunity to learn more about these enhancements and the work involved to construct them our project team will be holding OPEN DAY sessions soon at the Royal Road Primary School Hall, 112 Royal Road, Massey for the local community. Please call in at any time during the following times:

- Saturday 14 November, 10am – 2pm 
- Tuesday 17 November, 4pm – 7pm

The first works begin next Monday (9 November) and will involve some single lane closures (traffic management will be in place to minimise delays) while other repairs will be carried out at night to minimise disruption to traffic. 

SH1 Kaiwaka - From 9 November until 13 November
SH1 Hikurangi Bypass - From 16 November until mid-December
SH14 Maungatapere, Charles Walton Road to Snooks Road - From 16 November until 11 December

These works are an important part of maintaining the reliability and safety of Northland's highways for all road users. We thank you for being patient while we carry out this work.

How about if there was a toll of $1 per axle for the first two and $100 per axle after that, for trips over the bridge at busy times?

And would eliminating the short trips on the motorway reduce the merging traffic enough to make the motorway free flowing?  Perhaps a $1 toll for entering the motorway, free exits.  So someone going 1km on the motorway would find a different route, rather than hopping on to get off the next exit.

I can literally think of a million little ways to lower the traffic pressure on the motorways, but AT can only consider massive construction and punitive tolls.","0","0","0","","http://www.facebook.com/210306092376737/posts/941473912593281","comment",

Your asking to take alternative transport but taking one lane off which makes it harder to cycle. Can you please tell me your solution.

"2015-10-29T03:06:27+0000","nztaakl","NZ Transport Agency - Auckland & Northland","#ROADWORKS on Brynderwyn Hill

Contractors have begun ramping up work again in their second year of extensive safety improvements to State Highway 1 on the northern side of Brynderwyn Hill south of Whangarei.

The ongoing work involves widening the east side of the highway at the top of the hill to remove tight corners, which will mean significant earthmoving activity, and installing a wire rope barrier to separate north and south bound traffic - thereby reducing the risk of crashes and minimising the impacts of vehicles crossing the centre line.

There will be some disruption for motorists with the passing lane at the top of the hill closed while work is completed on this section (it is likely to remain closed until late February) and speed restrictions will keep motorists and those working in the area safe.

We apologise for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience during the work. ^TP","14","13","5","https://fbcdn-photos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xlp1/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/11222189_938939159513423_3469525661419384137_n.jpg?oh=f16a8948fe7b0bd343564f40a0f3678a&oe=56AD6454&__gda__=1457762154_42550b3b339078556bb79deccb3e472b","http://www.facebook.com/210306092376737/posts/938939659513373","post",

Please can you share this information this anyone who might be affected. Any detour routes are very long, and would add more than an hour to your travel ... more like day tours not detours. So expect to wait - or find a place to stop for a while.  Plenty of scenic spots in the gorge!

Motorists are advised to expect delays and avoid the area if possible until the road reopens. 

More information and latest updates can be found here.

The 21 km long Hamilton section of the Waikato Expressway will be constructed by a group made up of Fletcher, Beca, Higgins and Coffey (FBHC), in an alliance with the Transport Agency. 
The proposed design for the section includes five interchanges, 17 bridges and new connecting roads at Ruakura Road and Resolution Drive. The project is one of seven sections of the  Expressway, a Road of National Significance (RoNS) identified by the Government as key to unlocking New Zealand’s potential for economic growth. 
Construction is expected to start in spring 2016 and be completed by 2020.

We have considered moving the temporary 80km/h speed limit on SH1 to south of the Tamahere Interchange. The reason we haven't is because there is a passing lane in the northbound direction, and we don’t feel it is reasonable to expect motorists to adhere to a temporary 80km/h speed limit on a passing lane when there is no road work activity in this area.  In relation to your speeding concerns, when you notice this, you could inform the Police by calling *555 free from a mobile phone, or use their Roadwatch service http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/driving-and-road-safety/report-bad-driver.

From Monday 16 - Friday 20 November drivers can expect minor delays with a 50km/h speed restriction in place through the 3.5km length between 6am – 6pm, and 80km/h between 6pm - 6am. The remainder of the Toll Road will be unaffected. Drivers also have the option to use the Te Puke Highway.
Once completed this will mean the full length of the TEL will have an asphalt surface which is designed to minimise noise and water spray.

"2015-11-04T03:49:01+0000","NZTAWaikatoBoP","NZ Transport Agency Waikato BoP","Today's rain saw the first use of the new weather-activated road signs with adjustable speed limits on SH29 over the Kaimai Range. 
The 22 high-tech signs were activated just before 8am and displayed until just after 2pm when weather and road conditions had improved. Speeds were dropped to 60km/h on the Waikato side and 80km/h on the Bay of Plenty side. Three advance electronic signs displayed "Slippery road Reduce speed".
The innovative two year trial aims to get people driving at safe speeds that are appropriate to the road and conditions. Over 70% of the crashes on the Kaimai Range occur in wet weather, and over 40% of these were caused by drivers driving too fast for the conditions.

Summer journeys – coming soon to a person like you

This summer, the NZ Transport Agency is asking people travelling to work or on holiday to be smart and plan ahead to stay safe and avoid delays.

You can do this by going online and checking this summer journeys web page for up to date information on road works, detours and delays. Or you can call 0800 444 449 or follow us on Facebook or Twitter. 

Each summer, Transport Agency work crews make the best use of the weather and longer daylight hours to repair and maintain state highway road surfaces when air temperatures are warmer and dryer. This means new seal sticks more effectively to the existing road surface and they can make good progress on keeping our state highways safe and well maintained. But it also means that there are more people working on the roads and some delays.

Keep an eye out for warning and speed restriction signs. 

The Transport Agency doesn’t have any active work sites during public holiday periods like Christmas, New Year, and Waitangi weekend – except for emergencies.

The more people plan the better prepared they will be for a smoother, more predictable journey. Building in time reduces the pressure when there is an inevitable delay en route for whatever reason.

“We want all our crews, and other people using the state highway network, to get home safely. People need to slow down through road works,” says Transport Agency Journey Manager Lee Wright. “Everyone has a role to play in reducing harm on our roads, so we’re asking people to be patient and observe temporary speed restrictions. These are in place to protect the safety of the road workers and to limit damage to any works already under construction.”

Safety is everyone’s responsibility, which means having safe roads, safe drivers, safe speeds and safe vehicles.

For the latest highway conditions 
• phone 0800 4 HIGHWAYS (0800 44 44 49)
• visit the Summer Journeys page for regional updates
• check the Transport Agency’s South Island Facebook pages or twitter pages –  NZTA Canterbury/West Coast  @NZTACWC or NZTA Otago/ Southland @NZTAOS","1","0","0","https://fbcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/v/t1.0-0/p130x130/12193443_910747245676326_5138622897174058521_n.jpg?oh=66f130851811966fa3a7dd816221e525&oe=56F63972&__gda__=1457987220_8fde2b11610f3bf9fbb93b01bd36769b","http://www.facebook.com/515412995209755/posts/910747245676326","post",

"2015-10-29T21:35:16+0000","nztasouthisland","NZ Transport Agency - South Island","MEDIA RELEASE:

Drivers on the Canterbury-West Coast highway (State Highway 73) through the Otira Gorge should build in extra time over the next few weeks. 

The NZ Transport Agency is reattaching a guard rail to the edge of the precipitous road, requiring traffic lights and one lane of traffic only.

Delays could be five to ten minutes, on a steep slope in both directions.

Work is likely to start on Monday 2 November, weather dependent, and run until 20 November. The traffic lights will operate 8 am to 5 pm, Monday to Friday, while the crew is working on the guard rail.

A rockslide at the Rock Shelter at the end of September (external link)  wiped out several metres of the guard rail and initially required a short term closure while the road was cleared and the slope sluiced for loose material.

The Rock Shelter is on the West Coast side of the Otira Gorge. The road has been narrowed but operating with two lanes since the slip, with temporary edge protection in places.

The Transport Agency thanks all drivers for being patient while this important piece of work is completed for everyone’s safety.","38","15","6","https://fbcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xta1/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12190054_908681019216282_329702762661176493_n.jpg?oh=bb26f0fb6ce94ca9b739900320c72402&oe=56F5E06C&__gda__=1456802713_934013fca305e340bc1cb67e74f56a44","http://www.facebook.com/515412995209755/posts/908681019216282","post",

 Kakaho Creek Bridge, North Otago, one-way for four weeks from 2 November – next week
 
As the final part of the strengthening and widening work on the Kakaho Creek Bridge, North Otago, the NZ Transport Agency will reduce the bridge to one lane and one-way only for four weeks from early November.

The bridge is on State Highway 1, 3km north of Hampden.

Traffic signals will control traffic flows for the four weeks while the new part of the bridge is joined to the existing structure. 

Road users should allow extra travel time for their trips on SH1 between Palmerston and Oamaru in November, said Phil Dowsett, Transport Agency Senior Project Manager. 

People attending the 18 November Fleetwood Mac concert in Dunedin should also factor in a short delay at the bridge heading south, he said.

In recent months, the bridge has been strengthened for HPMV (High Productivity Motor Vehicle – a heavy haulage freight truck with loads from 45 to 58 tonnes) usage.

The strengthening is being followed by widening, almost double the existing width, with six new piles up to nine metres deep required to support the broader structure.

The approaches to the bridge are also being widened and the curves eased to improve safety, particularly for truck drivers. 

The $1.6M project by contractor Fulton Hogan had progressed well, Mr Dowsett said. The bridge would reopen to two lanes early December.","0","2","0","","http://www.facebook.com/515412995209755/posts/908263732591344","post",

•	Saturday 28 November: 10:00pm-7:00am. 
•	Sunday 29 November: 10:00pm-5:30am

Detours will be in place so you’ll still be able to get to where you need to go – it will just take a little bit longer than normal. We are encouraging motorists to avoid the area during the closures (if possible).

"2015-11-10T07:40:05+0000","nztawgtn","Lynne King","Further to our discussion about the Johnsonville Road - Fraser Avenue traffic lights, it would be helpful if there were left and right turning lanes at the bottom of Fraser Ave as there used to be. You have made ridiculously wide footpaths on either side - if they were smaller there would be plenty of room for two lanes into Johnsonville Road. 

The wide footpath in front of the lighting shop also makes the left turn from Johnsonville Road into Fraser Ave very tight. It always was - why didn't you take the opportunity to improve it? I saw the bank being cut back and thought, at last, a smoother corner, but no, it's actually worse than it was before the alterations. I ride a motorbike and that turn is difficult, the camber isn't right for a bike.","0","0","0","","http://www.facebook.com/326170274196469/posts/769158533230972","post",

"2015-11-06T04:59:09+0000","nztawgtn","Lynne King","As I expected, the lights at the corner of Johnsonville Road and Fraser Avenue are causing traffic delays. Previously it was easy to turn right out of Fraser Avenue to head down the Gorge, with waits of no more than a minute or two except at peak time. Now we have to wait several minutes when there are no cars on Johnsonville Road. I have seen up to eighteen cars waiting in Fraser Avenue, and needless to say half of them don’t get through on the green light and have to wait for another round. This is another example of taking away people’s ability to make their own decisions. Why not use the lights at peak time only and for the rest of the time change them to flashing orange and leave us to get with managing perfectly well without help.","0","0","2","","http://www.facebook.com/326170274196469/posts/767379943408831","post",

Earlier Post;
RIMUTAKA HILL - SLIP

Expect delays if you are travelling on State Highway 2 over the Rimutaka Hill today as a large slip is currently blocking the southbound lane.

Emergency Services are on site working to clear the slip but it may take a number of hours to be cleared which could cause delays for those travelling later tonight.

Please drive to the conditions as bad weather means visibility is low, the road is slippery and more slips could come down. Consider taking the train to avoid the hassle altogether ( https://www.metlink.org.nz/timetables/train/WRL/outbound ).

They have just warned to expect delays.

The Southern Ventilation Building and crane lifts to take down a 50 tonne Gantry Crane.

"The gantry cranes were used to unload the segments as they arrived from East Tamaki PreCast yard then load them again onto the multi-service vehicles for transport to Alice where they formed the tunnel lining.  This crane, along with its pair, has performed over 20,000 lifts in the past 2 years all with no serious incident or injury.  That is a tribute to the three crews that operated these cranes day and night and the care and pride they took in their jobs." -  Grant Maclean, Senior Project Engineer.

• Take the time to check your vehicle is safe before you leave –tyres/ spare tyre, indicators, windshield wipers, lights.

• Allow plenty of time – make your journey part of the holiday.

• Rest stops are important for the driver and passengers.

• If possible, share the driving.

• Many drivers will be on unfamiliar roads, (external link)  so please be patient as we are all in this situation at some stage.

We are a homeschooling family, and the twin boys (aged 6) would like to know why you were turning anticlockwise when you came out of the tunnel at Waterview, but you were turning clockwise when you came out of the tunnel at the Maioro end.  Could you please let us know?  Thank you very much.  :-)  :-)","0","4","1","","http://www.facebook.com/171824959656543/posts/477777129061323","post",

Secondly, a fantastic question! Alice’s cutter head rotates in both directions, clockwise and anti-clockwise, to keep the TBM balanced. This prevents it from overturning completely which would occur if the cutter head were to rotate only in one direction. Alice changes its rotations every few minutes between clockwise and anticlockwise. :)","0","0","0","","http://www.facebook.com/171824959656543/posts/477777129061323","comment",

"2015-10-27T22:52:01+0000","waikatoexpressway","Waikato Expressway","Cambridge section: Another milestone was reached today with iwi blessing two of the three section interchanges. Mana whenua gathered just after dawn on the Victoria Interchange to bless and name the Te Oko Horoi Bridge. They then travelled south to the Southern Interchange to bless and name the Te Koo Utu Bridge.
About 20 members of  Ngaati Koroki Kahukura and Ngaati Hauaa turned out today. The last structure on the section to be blessed will be the Karaapiro Gully Viaduct, which will be done prior to the section opening. 
The bridge names are closely linked to the Cambridge area, and second Maori King Tawhiao who led his people there in the traumatic period during and after the land wars.
Te Oko Horoi takes its name from wash bowl and Te Koo Utu is the name of the Cambridge lake where Tawhiao symbolically washed his face, in a gesture of healing the grief and sorrow that followed the land wars of the early 1860s.","12","25","7","https://fbcdn-photos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfa1/v/t1.0-0/s130x130/12189545_945810442158397_812278503303139586_n.jpg?oh=bf843d4b5556ab71a25c1f0fad1fa863&oe=56D8FCBD&__gda__=1459052243_25720f7301e88e5f05098521f8594807","http://www.facebook.com/196682197071229/posts/945811098824998","post",
